'I cannot believe for one moment,' said Arthanius in a low voice, '
that Judas would have allowed himself to be caught by any ruffians within
the city limits. The street is no place for a clandestine murder. Therefore
he must have been enticed into some cellar or courtyard. But the secret
service has already made a thorough search of the Lower City and if he were
there they would have found him by now. They have not found him and I am
therefore convinced that he is not in the city. If he had been killed a long
way from Jerusalem, then the packet of money could not have been thrown into
the High Priest's palace so soon. He was murdered near the city after they
had lured him out.'
